Linux:
Giving super user rights:
1) sudo su

Creating files in linux:

2) cat >file1.txt  (press enter)
   Hello world 
   (to exit this file1.txt you should press ctrl d) 

(it will create a file with name file1 with extension txt and 
content hello world)

3) ls    (list ...you should be able to see file1.txt) 

4) cat file1.txt   (to see the content of the file1.txt ) 

5) to clear screen write clear or press ctrl l 

6) cat >>file1.txt 
Hello akshat 
(press ctrl d to exit )   (this will add hello akshat below Hello world in file1.txt)

7) cat file1.txt      (o/p Hello world
                           Hello akshat)

8) Lets say i have two files a.txt and b.txt . Now a.txt has content -> I am learning devops
and b.txt has content -> Linux is first topic . Now i want to concatenate a.txt and
b.txt and create a new file with name all which will have content of both a.txt and b.txt

cat > a.txt
I am learning Devops 
(press ctrl d to exit) 

cat > b.txt
Linux is first topic
(press ctrl d to exit) 

cat a.txt b.txt > all.txt   (here a.txt and b.txt would be concatenated to become all.txt )

ls 

cat all.txt  (you will see o/p : I am learning devops
				 Linux is first topic )

9) Touch command: -> Created the empty file 
	          -> Create multiple files at a time (with a single command) 
 		  -> Change the timestamp (you can see time when the file created, modify time,change time) 
            

10) touch abc.txt   (it will create a file abc.txt without any content (empty file) )

11) ls    (you will see abc.txt)

12) cat abc.txt  (you will see no content because this file is empty) 

13) touch file3 file4.txt file5 file6 file7 file8   (it will create multiple blank files)

14) stat file3   (it will show the timestamp )

15)  Lets say i have created a file with name akshat.txt ...i added content that akshat is teaching 
devops certification . later you want to delete the content of the file ...(empty the file) 

cat > akshat.txt
akshat is teaching devops certification 
(press ctrl d to exit)

now i want to empty the file :

cat akshat.txt   (you will see content: akshat is teaching devops certification )

>akshat.txt       (this command will delete everything in akshat.txt)

cat akshat.txt  (you will see akshat.txt content is deleted ) 


16) Vi editor : text editor   (for example it will create a file for you and open that file so that you can put the content into the file)

vi devops.txt

(the devops.txt file editor will open in front of you )

To start inserting in the file devops.txt press i   (which is insert) 
hello simplilearn,
hope you are doing great .
i am also good. I am leanring devops today

now to save the file :   
(press esc and then) 
:w -> save the file but not quit
:q ->  quit the file but not save 
:wq or :x-> save the file and quit

(to come out of file press esc :wq) 

cat devops.txt 


17) Creating a directory  (it is a folder in which we can create the files) 

mkdir akshat  

(create a directory (folder) with name akshat ) 

cd akshat 

(change directory to akshat ..you will get inside akshat directory) 

pwd     (to see your current working directory use pwd command)  (o/p : /home/ec2-user/akshat)

mkdir a1 a2 a3   (it will create multiple directories for you)

ls   (you will see a1 a2 and a3) 

cd ..     (between cd and .. there should be space )( go back one step ) 

pwd   (o/p: /home/ec2-user) 

###########GOING BACK 2 steps in a directory###

cd akshat 
cd a1
pwd
cd ../..  (you will go back 2 steps)
pwd
